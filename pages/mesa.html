          <h2>MESA</h2>
          <p class="lead mb-5">Every Friday for the past four years, I have stayed after school to attend the weekly meeting for my school’s MESA chapter. For the first two, I watched as the president and vice president stood at the front. For the latter two, I have been at the front, speaking before some of the most talented, unique, and creative individuals I have ever had the privilege of knowing. I am currently the vice president Santa Teresa High School’s prestigious MESA chapter, and I am extremely grateful for how being in MESA has contributed to my personal achievement, helped me achieve my goals, and developed me as a leader. When I joined MESA as a freshman, the club had less than thirty members. We were a close knit family, going on field trips to NASA and General Electric, and, most importantly, going to MESA day. After going on these field trips and learning about potential job opportunities, I knew I had to go into STEM as a computer programmer. I also enjoyed the feeling of going up on stage to claim the reward for the hard work I had put into my mousetrap car and balsa wood plane. My dedication to the MESA club continued through my sophomore year and led me to run for and win the position of vice president of the club. By junior year, my first year as vice president, the club had amassed over sixty members. We were certain this would be the most interesting year we ever had due to the sheer number of members to manage. Though it went off to a rocky start, by the time MESA day came around, our teams were well prepared to succeed and we claimed a majority of the high school prizes. That year, I won not only first place in NEDC but also useful experience in leading the MESA chapter. I learned how to speak with confidence and manage many people while delegating tasks to appropriate board members.
    This experience won me vice president again for my senior year with eighty members. I, along with the president, guided my club to outstanding victory at MESA Day, where we managed to win over seventy percent of all possible prizes. I am excited to represent my club at the state level NEDC competition this year at UCLA.
    Throughout my four years, MESA has been a pillar of my high school experience. It has been a segway through which I have made many acquaintances and friends. It has helped me decide which career I would like to go into. It has shaped me into the leader I am today. Ultimately, my MESA experience has been nothing short of incredible.
